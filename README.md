# Flask-Data-Viewer
Basic flask app to view some data.
This web application is separated into two views:
The first view displays a line graph with any state's senate, house, or presidential election results over time. Users select the state and race via a dropdown and the graph updates to reflect the selection.
The second view is a basic dashboard with two interesting insights--a pie chart displaying what happens to popular candidates and a bar graph comparing voter turnout over time and between races.

To access the application:
1. Run the server by navigating to the directory and running:
"python3 main.py" (or whatever version of python you have)
2. Navigate to the localhost URL flask is configured to show
